# dot-emacs
My .emacs.d.

Probably requires a recent build from master to actually work. I don't bother with backward compatibility for versions I don't use.

Some system packages required for an emacs package will be installed when the package is first loaded. In some cases the emacs package won't start correctly until the next invocation, however.
